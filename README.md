## Steps Taken

## How to use

- For now simply open the `.shader` files in some text editor and copy into your
personal ShaderToy project.

### Note for Jiro: Document everything and once we get things working, take screen shots and upload them onto this `README`.
- When working on things, please split into branches and don't push into master unless fully implemented.
- Be aware of TODOs on the repos.
