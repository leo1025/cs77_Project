# Solar System simulation
Iosef Casas, Jiro Mizuno

## Project

## Details

## Initial Goals
###Render the solar system:
Orbital movement:
- Multiple Objects on Ray-Tracing/Sphere-Tracing base
- Single Keplerian Orbit
- Multiple Keplerian Orbits
Procedurally generated texture:
- Earth
- Rocky (the moon)
- Gas
Integrating both: (unseen problems including)
- Integration in general
- Adjusting soft shadow function for the sun
- Camera movement


## How to use

- For now simply open the `.shader` files in some text editor and copy into your
personal ShaderToy project.

### Note for Jiro: Document everything and once we get things working, take screen shots and upload them onto this `README`.
- When working on things, please split into branches and don't push into master unless fully implemented.
- Be aware of TODOs on the repos.
